#Goals
This is the very early stages of my first statically typed functional programming language.
The goal of this project is to get the language to successfully type check and compile down to C.

#Syntax

Syntax is subject to change, at the moment it is similar to ruby such that:

```
tydef foo() => Integer
fndef foo()
   1
end
``` 

represents a very simple function
